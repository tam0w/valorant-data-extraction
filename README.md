# Practistics Scrim OCR

Practistics is an open-source OCR tool designed to capture and analyze VALORANT private scrim matches. It automatically extracts data from match scoreboards, summaries, and timelines, converting them into structured CSV data for analysis.

## Quick Start

1. Install Python 3.11 from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download and unzip Practistics
3. Install Dependencies

GPU Acceleration (Optional but Recommended)
If you have an **NVIDIA GPU** that supports **CUDA** for faster processing, follow these steps:

1. Install the **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit** incase you havent:  
   [Download CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (Recommended Toolkit Version=12.4)

2. Verify the installation:
   ```sh
   nvcc --version
   ```

3. Go to [PyTorch's official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and select the appropriate PyTorch build for your CUDA version.

4. If you have **CUDA 12.4**, install PyTorch with the following command:
   ```sh
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
   ```
   If you have a **different CUDA version** that is not listed in the PyTorch documentation, you may need to **build PyTorch from source** to ensure compatibility.

Install Other Dependencies
For all users, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. Run the tool with the `python main.py` command and press:
   - `S` on match summary screen
   - `B` on scoreboard
   - `P` on each round timeline
   - `Q` when finished
   - Let it process

## Documentation

- [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) - Getting started with Practistics (includes GPU setup)

## Why Practistics?

Traditional scrim reviews often miss the subtle patterns that emerge across multiple matches. Practistics captures these patterns by converting match data into structured formats, allowing teams to:
- Track performance trends across multiple scrims
- Analyze round-specific strategies and outcomes
- Identify patterns in economy management and site control
- Build data-driven practice routines

## Project Status

This project is currently not in active development. It was created to fill the gap in accessing hidden scrim data and help teams analyze their practice matches. While functional, it's one of my earlier projects and contributions/improvements are welcome.
